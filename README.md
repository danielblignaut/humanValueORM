# humanValue ORM

## ORM/UserModel class
- Create an ORM class demonstrating CRUD.
- The class should store data in sqlite/mysql database.
- Proper security of the database should be demonstrated.
- The UserModel class should extend a base ORM class.
- The UserModel class should specify a validator for the
  email attribute, to make sure the email is valid, otherwise
  it should throw a catchable error.

## Unit test
- Get PHPUnit via composer.
- Create just one unit test that tests the email validation script.

## When you're done:
- dump the sql file (if you're using mysql), and place in the root.
- git push the codebase to a new public repo on Github, and 
  share the link with us.
